# Cat
Our indoor cat Clementine is a 3 year old tabby that we got very young as a rescue from the family farm. She is very friendly and spends a good portion of her day sleeping on one of the couches or beds in the house. Clementine is pretty low maintenance; if her biscuits are topped up, her litter clean and water bowls filled, she is very happy cat.

?> If the cat gets outside accidentally, grab her biscuit tub from her room and go out and call her, don’t stress she will probably come running back. If you can’t find her, just leave the front door open and she will come back when she is ready.

## Food and Water
### Biscuits
Her bowls are in her room under the stairs. We generally top these up once a day.

### Treats
These are in a tall container next to her bowl and we give her these after a walk if we haven't saved her anything in the fridge. If we have cut up some raw chicken, prawns, fish, red meat etc. we will often give this to her and just pop it on her food mat next to her bowls.

### Water Bowl
Her water bowl is on the tv unit upstairs in the retreat. We change this every second day.

## Cat Room
### Litter
Clean out any poo from the cat litter (might only need doing every second day) with scoop on side of litter tray. This goes into a blue bags (just near litter) and thrown in garbage bin outside.

### Lights and Purifier
The light stays on it's lowest setting all day and night. The air purifier is on a timer and runs during the day.

## Walking
She just needs one walk per day. We usually take her out the front in the late afternoon for 15 minutes, but do it whenever it suits you. The harness with lead is in the laundry in a basket on the shelves. If she goes near trees be careful not to give her too much lead as she loves to climb them and sometimes goes a bit high and gets stuck!
