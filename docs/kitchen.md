# Kitchen

Feel free to help yourself to anything in the kitchen to prepare your meals.

## Benchtops
The skullery is walnut and pretty resilient just avoid leaving water or spirits on the tops as it may stain. The main kitchen is cast concrete with a PU finish. This is also pretty tough but can't take heat like ceasar stone so requires a matt for hot pots.

## Drawers
These are blum tiptronics and simply require a light, quick press to open. They can be a bit 'grabby' on close and jam fingers! If you have small children around keep an eye out!

## Dishwashers
We put nearly everything in the dishwashers with the exception of:
- Wooden chopping boards
- Wooden cooking utensils
- Kitchen knifes
- Cast Iron pans
- Wok
