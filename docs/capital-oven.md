# Large Gas Oven
This oven is full gas with auto ignition.

## Cooktop
Rotate dial to `Max` and the burner will light. If the burner gets blown out it will automatically start clicking and re-ignite.

?> **Note**: If the burner is on the lowest setting and continually clicks it, is on the point of going out and the stove is trying to reignite the burned. This is also often due to the burner needing a clean. Simply raise the flame until it stops clicking.

?> **Note**: Please use the range hood fan if doing any oily cooking.
