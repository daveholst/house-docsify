# Large Gas Oven
This oven is full gas with auto ignition.

## Cooktop
Rotate dial to `Max` and the burner will light. If the burner gets blown out it will automatically start clicking and re-ignite.

**Note**: If the burner is on the lowest setting and continually clicks it, is on the point of going out and the stove is trying to reignite the burned. This is also often due to the burner needing a clean. Simply raise the flame until it stops clicking.

**Note**: Please use the range hood fan if doing any oily cooking.

## Oven
Simply Rotate the `Oven` dial to the desired temperate with the door closed and the unit will automatically ignite (after ~30seconds) and start pre-heating. The `BAKE` light should be green. The `BAKE` light will go out when the oven is at set temperature.

`Light` and `Fan` can be turned on with the red switches.

## Range Hood
This unit exhausts externally. The filter elements can be run through the dishwasher if overly oily.
