# Washing Machine

This Miele unit is self dosing which means it has a hatch down the bottom with 2 containers of liquid detergent. The machine will let you know if it has run out of detergent and we have more in the tall cupboard opposite the machine. Everything else is pretty straight forward and we generally use the `Cottons` cycle on `short`.

!> This washing machine has it's own detergent. Do not add it to the drawer!

## Unable to cancel a programme

This washer has a bit of a quirk where it can get into a funny state if you try and change programmes.

This video will walk you through how to get it 'unstuck'.
