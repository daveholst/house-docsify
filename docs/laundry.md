# Laundry
The laundry should have most cleaning items under the trough or in the large builtin cupboard. Spare linens and towels are in the overhead cupboards.

## Laundry Door
This is a digital lock and handy for getting in and out without having to carry keys. This door will automatically lock once closed. A code will be provided for the door on the fridge. This can be entered on the keypad followed by the tick button.
